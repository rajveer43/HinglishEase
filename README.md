# Hinglish Translation Model - HINGLISHEase

This repository contains a Python-based Hinglish translation model that can convert English sentences into Hinglish, making them easy to understand for non-native Hindi speakers. This README file will provide detailed information on how to run the model, evaluate its performance, and understand the algorithm used.

## 1. Introduction

Hinglish is a hybrid language that combines elements of Hindi and English. This model aims to translate English sentences into Hinglish while maintaining simplicity and ease of understanding. It is designed to make the translated text sound natural, like it's spoken by a casual Hindi speaker.

## 2. Algorithm

The algorithm used in this model follows these steps:

1. Tokenization: The input English sentence is tokenized into individual words.
2. Translation: Each English word is translated into its Hinglish equivalent using a predefined mapping of words and phrases. Some words are retained in English to enhance understandability.
3. Post-processing: The translated words are concatenated to form the final Hinglish sentence. Punctuation and spacing are adjusted for readability.

## 3. Usage

To use the Hinglish translation model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hinglishease.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd hinglish-translation

3. Install the required dependencies (you may need to create a virtual environment):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the translation script with your input sentence:

   ```bash
   python translate.py "Your English input sentence here."
   
5. The script will output the corresponding Hinglish translation.

## 4. Evaluation

The model will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accuracy: How well does the generated Hinglish text convey the meaning of the original English sentence while keeping it simple and easy to understand?
Fluency: Does the translated text sound natural, like it's spoken by a casual Hindi speaker?
Understandability: Is the translated text clear and easy to understand for non-native Hindi speakers?

## 5. Results

The results of the model's performance will be assessed based on the evaluation criteria mentioned above. The model aims to produce Hinglish translations that are accurate, fluent, and highly understandable.

## Sample Output

Here is an example of how the model works:

Input: "I had about a 30 minute demo just using this new headset."
Output: "मझु ेसि र्फ ३० minute का demo मि ला था इस नये headset का इस्तमे ्ल करने के लि े"
